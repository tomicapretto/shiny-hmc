The MCMC algorithm starts with a random draw for the momentum from a Gaussian distribution
$$
\boldsymbol{v} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{M})
$$

To update both $\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, we need to simulate Hamiltonian
dynamics using Hamilton's equations, which describe the change in $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ and 
$\boldsymbol{v}$ as a function of time $t$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\boldsymbol{\theta}}{dt} &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \boldsymbol{v}} \\
\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt} &= -\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\theta}}
\end{aligned}
$$

As a result, we would obatin a new position vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}'$ that is 
uncorrelated from the position in the previous step $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.

Unfortunately, these equations cannot be solved analytically, and consequently it is not 
possible to simulate Hamiltonian dynamics exactly.
