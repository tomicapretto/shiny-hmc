If we could simulate Hamiltonian dynamics exactly, we would always accept the proposed
positions. However, it's needed to account for numerical errors during integration with
a Metropolis acceptance step. The probability of accepting the proposal $(\boldsymbol{\theta}', \boldsymbol{v}')$
generated by transitioning from $(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{v})$ is

$$
\min(1, \exp\left(\mathcal{H}(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{v}) - \mathcal{H}(\boldsymbol{\theta}', \boldsymbol{v}') \right))
$$

If this approximation is good, then 
$\mathcal{H}(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{v}) - \mathcal{H}(\boldsymbol{\theta}', \boldsymbol{v}')$ 
would be small, and the acceptance rate will be high.
