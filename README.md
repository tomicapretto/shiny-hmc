# ShinyHMC

An interactive Shiny app to learn about Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling.

This is still a work in progress.
I do have a couple of ideas to try and I would like to document everything a bit more.
Suggestions are more than welcomed :)

## Installation

Install this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tomicapretto/shiny-hmc")
```

## Run application

The function `run_app()` fires up the application. Just do

``` r
shinyhmc::run_app()
```

and have fun!

## How it looks
